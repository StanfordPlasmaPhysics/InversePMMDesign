#This configuration file is used to initialize the object associated with the 
#in-situ inverse design system. Refer to class initialization to see how the 
#parameters are read. The most important thing to note is that the slave
#addresses must correspond to the array coordinates mod 128;
#slave id = (i+array-x*j)%128 where i is the x-coordinate and j is the y-coordinate

array-a: 0.02 #lattice constant in m
array-x: 10 #xdim of array
array-y: 10 #ydim of array
mobility: 0 #electron mobility, in m^2/V/s
